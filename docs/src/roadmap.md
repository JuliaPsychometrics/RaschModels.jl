# Roadmap

RaschModels.jl is still under active development. 
Therefore, not all planned functionality is available yet. 
This roadmap provides a quick overview of the current state of the package.

## Existing features
- Fitting Rasch Models (CML estimation, Bayesian estimation)
- Fitting Rating Scale Models (Bayesian estimation)
- Fitting Partial Credit Models (Bayesian estimation)
- Item response functions (all model types)
- Item information functions (all model types)
- Test response functions/Expected score functions (all model types)
- Test information functions (all model types)

## Features in development
- Fitting Rating Scale Models via CML
- Fitting Partial Credit Models via CML
- Linear model extensions (Linear Logistic Test Model, Linear Rating Scale Model, Linear Partial Credit Model)
- Variational inference for Bayesian models

## Planned features
- Model evaluation
- Model comparison
